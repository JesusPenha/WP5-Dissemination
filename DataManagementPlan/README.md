<h4>Data Summary</h4>
This project aims at building and evaluating an on-line master program of High Energy Physics. The data output of the program will be a series of recorded lectures available in video, the material from the lectures and tutorials and collected data regarding the student quorum and performance. Data will be collected in the file formats … (estimated size of data: …). The methods of data collection and analysis are described in part ... of the proposal [Link/Deliverable X.X].
FAIR Data
<h4>Making data findable</h4>
Published data will be given DOI by the used repository and will be linked via the DOI to corresponding publications and to appropriate research information systems. 
<h4>Making data openly accessible</h4>
The research data will be archived following publications or project ending, and will be stored for at least 10 years. Archiving will be fulfilled self-responsibly at the chair or using the institutional archive system in accordance with TUD guidelines. Data relevant for other researchers will be made publicly accessible; especially the videos and materials will be published as Open educational resource (OER). For publishing we will use the TUD institutional repository OpARA or suitable disciplinary repositories, preferable at research data centers that were accredited, such as by the German Council for Social and Economic Data. Because of personal data, some of the collected data will not be made publicly accessible.
<h4>Making data interoperable</h4>
Data and metadata will be adequately documented enabling comprehension or reuse by other researchers in accordance with the FAIR principles. Whenever possible, the data will (also) be stored in non-proprietary open file formats (in particular, .csv additionally to .xls files). We will use suitable metadata standards or controlled vocabularies [give details if known] or document our own standards, if necessary. 
<h4>Increasing data re-use</h4>
During the course of the project, the project partners will discuss and specify the data to be archived. Access to videos and materials will be provided under an open license. Access to pseudonymised data will be provided by … (consortium leader/ chair …. / …) on an individual basis and password protected. Data quality will be assured through internal peer review processes. 
<h4>Responsibility and resources</h4>
Responsibility for data management during the project: …. 
Responsibility / contact person after the end of the project: 
The project uses the IT resources by the TUD and the support by the local Service Center Research Data. 
<h4>Data Organization and Data Security</h4>
The data collected in the project is stored centrally on servers of the TUD. Access to the research data is regulated through user rights. The research data is stored in a uniform structure and naming convention that is still comprehensible after the end of the project. Backup of data on TUD servers is conducted using a backup system of the ZIH. Project staff can use the ZIH backup service for their local data or fulfill their backup self-responsibly. The TUD provides a secure and fail-safe IT infrastructure for the mentioned services. 
<h4>Data Privacy and Ethical aspects</h4>
In accordance with the guidelines of IT security and with consultation of the data protection officer of the TUD, a concept for handling personal data is/was created to ensure data handling of personal data follows regulations by the GDPR and the TUD (see Data Protection Procedures in proposal/deliverable…). 
<h4>Other Issues / Policies</h4>
The data management in this project follows the EU Horizon 2020 guidelines on open access and data management and the Guidelines for Safeguarding Good Scientific Practice as well as the Guidelines on the Handling of Research Data of the TUD. We also keep attention to related disciplinary research data management guidelines such as by the German Council for Social and Economic Data (RatSWD) or the German Network for Educational Research Data (VerbundFDB) and follow activities of consortia of the German National Research Data Infrastructure (NFDI) such as KonsortSWD.
<h4>History of Changes</h4>
Current Version: …
Version 1	(XX.XX.2020)

During the course of the project, we will cooperate with the local Service Center Research Data in updating the data management plan.
