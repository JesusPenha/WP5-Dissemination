# Diversity Report


Collection of random sentences that could be used:

The following measures will be put in place to counteract the gender unbalance historically present in the field of high-energy physics is apparent already from the comparison between the involvement of female researchers in our activities, with respect to the world average, well represented by the CERN Laboratory Users.

Special attention will be devoted to female role models in promoting their involvement in scientific activities, and in supporting them in assuming leadership positions. At the same time, we consider relevant the training of young students, to trigger their interest in the fundamental research and to raise their awareness of the prime role they can play there.

Need to put in place specific measures to counterbalance the big gender discrepancy in our field(the fraction of women in the CERN Laboratory Staff is about 10%, and about 17% considering all the CERN Laboratory Users).


Consolidate the existing collaborations in the frame of a single coherent structure and create a long term community that will survive the end of this project.

Significantly improve the gender equality in the collaboration, with respect to the average distribution in the high-energy physics field.
