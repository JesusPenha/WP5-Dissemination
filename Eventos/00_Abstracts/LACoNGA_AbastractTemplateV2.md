# LA-CoNGA physics: a case study for open science education collaboration between Latin America and Europe

In the era of information technology, higher education is rapidly globalizing and is inseparable from research. The links between scientific institutions, society and industry, are strengthened, and the discussion about adopting Open Science principles is on the table. Virtual Teaching and Research Networks (VRLC) play a fundamental role in this process of modernization and internationalization of higher education. VRLCs create and offer new opportunities:
multi-institutional links favouring internationalization and diversity:
+ interconnected e-infrastructure
+ sharing software and open data
+ profitability and increased scientific production (essential for small institutions)
In addition, VRLCs expose their members (students, researchers, professors, and technicians) to various cutting-edge concepts and techniques not classically accessible. They also offer access to data and experimental facilities not available locally. In the current context, VRLCs and e-learning platforms are contributing to solve challenges, such as distance education during the COVID19 pandemic.

In Latin America and the Caribbean, the communities of astrophysics, astronomers and particle physicists have been pioneers in establishing VRLCs [1], generating productive international consortiums in virtual research environments. We will discuss one in particular, LA-CoNGA Physics (Latin American alliance for Capacity buildiNG in Advance physics) [2].

LA-CoNGA physics is a VRLC with Open Science education, and Open Data are at the heart of its operations. It comprises 11 universities (three in Europe and eight in Latin America) and 12 research and industrial partners and develops an innovative e-learning platform distributed in Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador and Peru. LA-CoNGA Physics will offer low-cost open-access tools, interconnected instrumentation laboratories, and a flexible problem-solving-oriented curriculum. The project is co-funded by the Erasmus+ Capacity Building program from the European Commission. 

LA-CoNGA physics contributes to the objectives of the Agenda for Sustainable Development 2030. In particular, the SDG4 goal (guarantee inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all) and the SDG9 goal (build sustainable infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization and foster innovation).
In this talk, we will discuss the importance, results, and challenges of these networks in higher education and research in Latin America and the Caribbean and the crisis context we live in today.
