# LA-CoNGA physics: a case study for open science education collaboration between Latin America and Europe

In the era of information technology, higher education is rapidly globalizing  and is inseparable from research. The links between scientific institutions, society and industry are strengthened and the discussion about adopting Open Science principles is on the table. Virtual Teaching and Research Networks (VRLC) play a fundamental role in this process of modernization and internationalization of higher education. VRLCs create and offer new opportunities: multi-institutional links favoring internationalization and diversity, interconnected e-infrastructure, sharing software and open data, profitability and increased scientific production (particularly important for small institutions). In addition, VRLCs expose their members (students, researchers, professors, and technicians) to a variety of cutting-edge concepts and techniques not classically accessible. They also offer access to data and experimental facilities not available locally. In the current context,  VRLCs and e-learning platforms are contributing to solve challenges, such as distance education during the COVID19 pandemic.

In Latin America and the Caribbean, the communities of astrophysics, astronomers and particle physicists have been pioneers in establishing VRLCs [1], generating international productive consortiums in virtual research environments. We will discuss one in particular, LA-CoNGA Physics (Latin American alliance for Capacity buildiNG in Advance physics) [2].

LA-CoNGA physics is a VRLC with Open Science education and Open Data are at the heart of its operations. The LA-CoNGA physics community is composed by 11 universities (3 in Europe and 8 in Latin America) and 12 research and industrial partners. We are developing an innovative e-learning platform distributed in 8 universities in Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador and Peru. LA-CoNGA Physics will offer low-cost open access tools, interconnected instrumentation laboratories, and a flexible problem-solving-oriented curriculum in a network of academic (CERN, ICTP, DESY, RedCLARA) and industrial partners. The project is co-founded by the Erasmus+ Capacity Building program from the European Commision. 

LA-CoNGA physics contributes to the objectives of the Agenda for Sustainable Development 2030. In particular, to the SDG4 goal (guarantee an inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all) and the SDG9 goal (build sustainable infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization and foster innovation).
In this talk we will discuss the importance, results and challenges of these networks in the context of higher education and research in Latin America and the Caribbean and in the crisis context we are living today.
